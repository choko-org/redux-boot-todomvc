# Redux Boot TODO MVC

This is the classic TODO MVC example using [React](), [Redux](http://redux.js.org) and [Webpack]() but also using [Redux Boot](https://github.com/choko-org/redux-boot) to demonstrate how it can simplify application development even more by adding modularization.

## What is [Redux Boot](https://github.com/choko-org/redux-boot)?

From the project page: Minimal Framework using [Redux](http://redux.js.org) to develop modularized universal (backend and frontend) applications, based on functional programming paradigms and friends such as Map and Reduce, Immutability and Reactive programming.

Redux boot is used on both the frontend and the backend applications. You can have a look at `index.js` and `server.js` files for how it's used on these two contexts respectively.
